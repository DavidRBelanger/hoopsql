# HoopsQL: Technical Interview & Resume Guide

*A comprehensive guide for presenting HoopsQL in interviews, on resumes, and in technical discussions*

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

**"I built HoopsQL - a domain-specific query language for NBA statistics that processes 1.6 million player game records. It features a custom compiler (lexer → parser → AST → SQL generator) that transforms intuitive basketball syntax like 'Player p = \"Kobe Bryant\" get games where p.points >= 40' into optimized SQL. The entire system ships as a 14MB JAR with zero external dependencies."**

**Key Numbers:**
- 1,627,438 player game records
- 76MB SQLite database
- Sub-second query response times
- 27 Java source files
- Zero-dependency distribution

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview
```
User Input: "Player p = 'Kobe' get games where p.points >= 40 order by most points limit 5"
     ↓
[LEXER] → Tokenizes into: [PLAYER, IDENTIFIER, EQUALS, STRING, GET, GAMES, ...]
     ↓
[PARSER] → Builds AST: QueryNode(PlayerAssignment, Scope, WhereClause, OrderBy, Limit)
     ↓
[PLANNER] → Generates SQL: "SELECT * FROM player_stats WHERE playerName = ? AND CAST(points AS INTEGER) >= ? ORDER BY CAST(points AS INTEGER) DESC LIMIT ?"
     ↓
[EXECUTOR] → Runs query and formats results with game count
```

### Core Components

#### 1. **Custom Lexer** (`Lexer.java`)
- **Purpose**: Converts raw text into meaningful tokens
- **Complexity**: Handles 20+ token types including basketball-specific keywords
- **Features**: String parsing with quotes, number recognition (int/float), operator detection

**Why Custom vs Regex**: "I built a proper lexer instead of regex parsing because it provides better error messages, handles edge cases cleanly, and is easily extensible for new syntax."

#### 2. **Recursive Descent Parser** (`Parser.java`) 
- **Purpose**: Transforms token stream into Abstract Syntax Tree
- **Approach**: Recursive descent for readability and control
- **Output**: Structured AST representing the complete query

**Design Decision**: "I chose recursive descent over parser generators (ANTLR, etc.) for full control over error handling and because the grammar is simple enough to implement cleanly by hand."

#### 3. **Query Planner** (`Planner.java`)
- **Purpose**: Converts AST into optimized SQL with proper field mapping
- **Pattern**: Visitor pattern for clean AST traversal
- **Features**: Type casting, field aliases, join generation for multi-player queries

**Key Innovation**: Automatic same-game detection - when multiple players are queried, it automatically adds `gameId` constraints so users don't need to understand database joins.

#### 4. **Execution Engine** (`HoopsQLRunner.java`)
- **Purpose**: Executes SQL and formats user-friendly results
- **Features**: Parameterized queries, result counting, intelligent field display
- **UX**: Shows total game count, formats stats nicely, handles large result sets

## Technical Achievements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized for player name and date lookups
- **Query Efficiency**: Parameterized statements prevent SQL injection and enable query plan caching
- **Result Streaming**: Large datasets processed efficiently with pagination
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource cleanup with try-with-resources

### Advanced Features

#### Multi-Player Query Intelligence
```java
// Input: Two players in same query
Player p = "Shaq" 
Player q = "Kobe"
get games where p.points >= 25 and q.points >= 25

// Generated SQL: Automatic same-game join
SELECT * FROM player_stats p1, player_stats p2 
WHERE p1.gameId = p2.gameId 
  AND p1.playerName = 'Shaquille O\'Neal'
  AND p2.playerName = 'Kobe Bryant' 
  AND CAST(p1.points AS INTEGER) >= 25
  AND CAST(p2.points AS INTEGER) >= 25
```

#### Smart Field Mapping
```java
// User writes intuitive basketball terms
"p.points" → "CAST(points AS INTEGER)"
"p.fg_percent" → "CAST(fieldGoalsPercentage AS REAL)" 
"p.made_threes" → "CAST(threePointersMade AS INTEGER)"
"p.rebounds" → "CAST(reboundsTotal AS INTEGER)"
```

#### Intelligent ORDER BY Processing
- Supports both `order by most points` and shorthand `most points`
- Automatic numeric casting to prevent string sorting issues
- ORDER BY fields automatically included in SELECT for display

## Key Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: ORDER BY Numeric Sorting Bug
**Problem**: Query results were incorrectly sorted - "5 points" appeared after "30 points"
**Root Cause**: SQLite stores numbers as TEXT, so "30" < "5" lexicographically
**Investigation Process**: 
1. Built debug utility to trace SQL generation
2. Identified string vs numeric comparison issue
3. Discovered ORDER BY fields missing from result display

**Solution**:
```java
// Before (broken)
ORDER BY points DESC

// After (working)  
ORDER BY CAST(points AS INTEGER) DESC
```
**Impact**: Perfect numeric sorting with all ORDER BY fields visible in results

### Challenge 2: User Experience Design
**Problem**: Basketball fans shouldn't need to learn SQL
**Solution**: Domain-specific syntax that reads like English
- `Player p = "Name"` instead of table aliases
- `p.points >= 40` instead of `CAST(points AS INTEGER) >= 40`
- `order by most points` instead of `ORDER BY points DESC`

### Challenge 3: Distribution Complexity  
**Problem**: Users don't want to install Maven, manage dependencies, or configure databases
**Solution**: Single 14MB fat JAR with embedded database
- Maven Shade plugin bundles all dependencies
- SQLite database included in distribution
- Simple `java -jar hoopsql.jar` execution

## Interview Question Responses

### "Walk me through a technical challenge you solved"

**The ORDER BY Debugging Story:**

"In HoopsQL, I discovered a sorting bug where `order by most points` showed incorrect results - games with 5 points appeared before games with 30 points. 

**Investigation**: I built a debug utility to trace the SQL generation and discovered the root cause: SQLite was storing numbers as TEXT, so "30" < "5" lexicographically.

**Solution**: I implemented automatic CAST operations (`ORDER BY CAST(points AS INTEGER) DESC`) and added field mapping to handle database column differences like `minutes` → `numMinutes`.

**Additional Issue**: I then noticed ORDER BY fields weren't appearing in the results. The problem was my query planner wasn't including ORDER BY fields in the SELECT clause.

**Final Solution**: Modified the field extraction logic to include ORDER BY fields in SELECT statements, ensuring users see the data they're sorting by.

**Result**: Perfect numeric sorting with complete field visibility. This taught me the importance of understanding data types at the storage layer, not just the application layer."

### "How do you approach system design?"

"HoopsQL demonstrates my **user-first design approach**:

**1. Domain Understanding**: I started by understanding how basketball fans think about data - they want natural language, not SQL.

**2. Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with a proper compiler pipeline. Each component (Lexer, Parser, Planner, Executor) has a single responsibility and can be tested independently.

**3. Extensibility**: The AST-based approach means adding new syntax features requires minimal changes across the system.

**4. User Experience**: Every design decision prioritizes ease of use - from the English-like syntax to the formatted output with game counts.

**5. Distribution**: Zero-dependency JAR means users need only Java - no configuration, no database setup, no Maven.

The key insight: **Make complex things feel simple**. The system does sophisticated query optimization and join generation, but users just write intuitive basketball queries."

### "Describe your testing strategy"

"HoopsQL uses **integration-focused testing** because correctness matters more than unit test coverage:

**Integration Tests**: Real queries against the actual 1.6M record database
```java
// Test real basketball scenarios
'Player p = \"Kobe Bryant\" get games where p.points >= 40 limit 5'
```

**Component Tests**: Each pipeline stage independently
- Lexer token generation accuracy
- Parser AST structure validation
- Planner SQL output correctness

**Manual Exploratory Testing**: Interactive CLI mode for discovering edge cases

**Performance Testing**: Query response time validation on large result sets

**Error Handling**: Malformed queries, type mismatches, empty results

The philosophy: **Test the user experience end-to-end**. If a basketball fan can't get accurate data easily, the implementation details don't matter."

### "How do you handle performance at scale?"

"HoopsQL demonstrates several performance techniques:

**Database Level**:
- Indexed player names and game dates for common access patterns
- Separate COUNT queries to avoid loading unnecessary data for totals
- Parameterized statements enable query plan caching

**Application Level**:
- Stream-based result processing to handle large datasets
- Smart pagination (limit 10 by default) prevents overwhelming users
- Efficient AST traversal using the Visitor pattern

**Memory Management**:
- Proper resource cleanup with try-with-resources
- Minimal object allocation in query processing hot paths

**User Experience**:
- Progressive disclosure - show count first, then details
- Fast startup with embedded database connection pooling

**Measurement**: I profile response times and monitor SQLite query plans to ensure indexes are being used effectively."
